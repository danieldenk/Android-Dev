# Android-Dev
This repository includes the sourcecode to the app that had to be developed for android during the Android Development class of VIA University College.

<strong>** For a better navigation throughout the app, and to understand each of the componants better, I have created a Flowchart which you can find in this directory. **</strong>

<strong>Please note:</strong>
Once you open the project, you are going to find a folder with deprecated classes. These were used to parse a JSON Object that was being received by the WIKIPEDIA API. Because it was not working as some of the objects had been nested up to 4 LEVELS!!!, I had decided to process the JSON Object instead, because it was more convenient and more than enough to implement my use case.

<u><strong>More facts:</strong></u>
<ul>
  <li>The implemented Database holds the data for the ingredients and recipes</li>
  <li>I have also created a translation into German for this app. You can find a screenshot in the root directory of this repository.</li>
