<strong>*** For a better navigation throughout the app, and to understand each of the componants better, I have also created a Flowchart which you can find in this directory. ***</strong>

<strong>Please note:</strong>
Once you open the project, you are going to find a folder with deprecated classes. These were used to parse a JSON Object that was being received by the WIKIPEDIA API. Because it was not working as some of the objects had been nested up to 4 LEVELS!!!, I had decided to process the JSON Object instead, because it was more convenient and more than enough to implement my use case.
